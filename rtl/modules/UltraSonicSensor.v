The UltraSoundSensor module that uses the HC-SR04 sensor 
useful informantion about this sensor that help you out understading it
The DataSheet Link : https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf
it has four pins:
1. Vcc (5V supply)
2. Trigger Pulse Input
3. Echo Pulse Output
4. Ground (0V)
It's Elevtric Parameter :
- Working Frequncy : 40Hz
- Its detection Range : [2cm , 4m]
- Measuring Angle : 15 Degrees (The cone-shaped detection area has a spread angle of 15 degrees)
This module works by emitting burst of UltraSonic pulses and measure how
long they takes to go back 
The formula that is used is pretty simple :  
IF the signal back, through high level , time of high output IO duration is 
the time from sending ultrasonic to returning. 
outputs: 
- When the distanceRAW value is below ENTRY_THRESHOLD, the car_entry signal is asserted.
- When the distanceRAW value is above EXIT_THRESHOLD, the car_exit signal is asserted.


    Formula: uS / 58 = centimeters or uS / 148 =inch; or: the 
    range = high level time * velocity (340M/S) / 2,
Attention : 
    - When tested objects, the range of area is not less than 0.5 square meters 
and the plane requests as smooth as possible, otherwise ,it will affect the 
results of measuring.
